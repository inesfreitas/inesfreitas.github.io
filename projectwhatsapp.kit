                    <p>The main challenge was the creation of a new feature for a widely know app.   This feature needed to be something new that would add value for the users of this app. </p>
                    <p>To handle his challenge we decided to develop a new feature for WhatsApp. </p>

                    <p>Following the analysis phase, we created a survey for Whatsapp users in order to find out what where the main problems they felt and how they use the app on a daily basis. </p>
                    <p>We also asked what other apps do they use, if they prefered them over Whatsapp and why.</p>
