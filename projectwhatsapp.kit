                    <p>The main challenge was the creation of a new feature for a widely know app.   This feature needed to be something new that would add value for the users of this app. </p>
                    <p>To handle his challenge we decided to develop a new feature for Whatsapp. </p>

                    <p>Did you know that an average user opens WhatsApp 23-25 times a day? </p>
                    <p>But such a number doesnâ€™t come as a surprise because users on an average spend 38 minutes using the app daily, which comes to about 19.4 hours a month. WhatsApp voice calls are also gaining steady popularity. </p>

                    <p>We also asked what other apps do they use, if they prefered them over Whatsapp and why.</p>
